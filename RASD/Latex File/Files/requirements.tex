\subsection{Design Constraints}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%T.

\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
The app shoudld be available for the two main operating systems of smartphones: Android Os and Apple iOS

The traffic violations which can be reported should be compliant to the local traffic code where the app will be used.
For an use in Italy the app should be compliant to the "Codice della Strada". Parking violations are reported in Art. 157.



\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The app will have a server side and a client side (smartphone).
On server side limitations can be the size of available storage and the bandwidth.
On smartphone side we have the network connectivity and GPS limitations in some areas.

\subsubsection{Any other constraint}
