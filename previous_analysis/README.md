 * Weakness: assumption of GPS always working is too generic: there should be something in case of no position acquired
 * Weakness: registration should be diversified for end users and third parties


# Sections 3

 * Weakness: no hardware interfaces stated, but there is need to specify the devices like smartphones/smartwatches etc.
 * strength: user Graphic interfaces are so realistic and well done
