The app will offer the possibility to the users to visualize the data collected.
Two kind of visualizations are offered:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Streets with the highest frequency of violations
  \item Veichles that commit the most violations
\end{enumerate}
In order to get those data the system will periodically query the database of violations in order to create a table where the count of violation is stored, both for streets and veichles.
There will be a section in the app called "Explore Data" where will be able to choose which kind of data to visualize.

\subsection{Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
\dom{1} The device should acquire position with an accuracy of enouth meters in order to univocally determine the road (e.g. 5 meters)
\dom{1} The device should take pictures with enouth resolution to be able to read the licence plate using the external software
\dom{}  Device has internet connection
\dom{2} Every veichle that can be reported shoud have a licence plate visible
\dom{3} The number and kind of violations should be finite (defined by the law)
\dom{4} Every authority account is verified and it's not possible to be created using the frontend
\dom{5} The third part service which reads the licence plate has an accuracy of more than 90\%

\end{enumerate}

The app will be dependent on a third-party service to read the licence plate of the cars. (For example \url{http://www.openalpr.com} )


The app will be dependent on a smartphone, which has to provide the following features:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Internet connection, possibily using 2G/3G/4G in order to be available where there is no WiFi, considering the use case "on the road"
  \item GPS sensor
\end{enumerate}
